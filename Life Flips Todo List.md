# Life Flips To Do List
## Things to do in order
#Projects/Life Flips#
### 0. Generate interest
~~- [ ] Fix email sign up for Interest page~~
~~- [ ] Improve on Interest page. As I develop screenshots and a clearer picture of what this product is, add to my Interest page. Interest page should eventually become my product description for product launch.~~

### 1. Get an idea of what it looks like
- [x] Make wireframe

This is a bit illegible (but thankfully I can still read it...that‚Äôs not always the case). I think I can prototype a working version quick enough where I can just move straight towards screenshots or demos to give you a better picture.

I tried looking up a bunch of wire framing / prototyping apps. Many good ones, but mostly subscription based, and lots more features than I need. I just drew a quick mock up above. This is all I need to get a picture in my head.

### 2. Develop first set of basic features
- [x] Build web viewer on iOS for iPad
- [x] Build up UICollectionView architecture
- [x] Cycle through multiple web viewers with slide right transition

### 3. Better loading experience
- [x] Pre-load the webpage before flipping

### 4. Let user add websites to list
- [x] Create an overview page
- [x] Add ‚Äò+‚Äô button to add page
- [x] Let user fill in url to be loaded
- [x] Save list of URLs to local persistent storage
- [x] Let user delete a webpage from list

### 5. Navigating slides
- [x] Slide left on slide to go forward
- [x] Slide right on slide to go to previous slide

#### 5.1 Cleaning up
- [x] Reformat website string entered by user
- [x] Highlight cell with incompatible url string, and add message saying url needs to be edited
- [x] Reset flip counter when tapping left or right
- [x] Add domain name and GLD as string (facebook.com) as title of cell
- [x] Add cross to delete button
- [x] Make sure delete button doesn‚Äôt appear when adding a new cell
- [x] Fix transition so that it pops up, not slides right. That way when we dismiss the top layer view, it doesn‚Äôt back track
- [x] Add icons for navigation toolbar items
- [x] Clean up cells and formatting

### 6. Get paid
- [ ] Add donation button
In the future, I‚Äôd like to include some premium features. But until I get user feedback, I don‚Äôt know what they might be yet. For now, I‚Äôll still add an option for users to donate, in case their feeling generous üòâ
